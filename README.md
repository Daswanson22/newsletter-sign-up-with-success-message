## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javscript
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through my question, I discovered that to make an SVG element fit the size of its parent DIV container, I need to use CSS to control the dimensions. By setting the width and height of the parent DIV to specific values, and then setting the SVG element's width and height to "100%", I can ensure that the SVG scales dynamically based on the dimensions of the parent container. This approach allows the SVG to automatically adjust and fit the size of the parent DIV, providing a responsive and flexible design.
